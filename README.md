# **My Portfolio** #

I started this project as a part of the JavaScript course I took with Udacity. In order to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript.

After the course I continued making the website aesthetically more pleasing and completely redesigned the layout and style to my liking. I wanted the website to be simple and elegant.

I proceeded to add more features such as the skill cloud, which I decided I wanted to do in React to get some more practice of React.

The whole website might be updated to React later and more features will be added.
