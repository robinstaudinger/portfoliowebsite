#My Portfolio

I started this project as a part of the JavaScript course I took with Udacity. I then continued making the website more aesthetically pleasing and updated the layout and style to my liking.

I proceeded to add more features such as the skill cloud, which I decided I wanted to do in React js to get some more practice of React.

The whole website might be updated to react later and more features will be added.
